# IMDB-Movie-Analysis

**Project Description**
The "IMDB Movie Success Analysis" project aims to provide valuable insights into the factors influencing the success of movies on the popular Internet Movie Database (IMDB).

You might look at the correlation between movie ratings and other factors like genre, director, budget, etc. You might also want to consider the year of release, the actors involved, and other relevant factors.
